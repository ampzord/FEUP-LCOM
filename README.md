# LCOM-FEUP
Repository for LCOM labs and project.

In this class we used Minix operating system using a Virtual Box where we handled several PC modules such as: 
  - PC's timer/counter
  - PC's keyboard
  - PC's mouse
  - PC's video card in graphics mode

The final project consisted of a remaking of a chillhood game called Bow and Arrow made by John Di Troia in 1992.

Using the configured PC modules we handled through the class we were able to recreate the essence of the original game.
